    <h4 id="1">1 Registration</h4>
    <p>Registration accepts new users, and requires personal details
        and a subscription payment. The aim of the subscription is to collect
        vital information to limit users to Dealers only.</p>
    <p>A unique CarZapp number is assigned to each new user.</p>
    <p>A username is selected by the new user and a password is
        created.</p>
    <h5>Information collected includes:</h5>
    <p>Personal Information:</p>
    <p>- Name, email, mobile phone number.</p>
    <p>Company Information:</p>
    <p>- Company name,</p>
    <p>- Dealer License Number / CarZapp Number.</p>
    <p>Note: In the case of a Dealership that includes more than one
        user for the app, The Dealer principle needs to register first and
        provide the Dealer License Number. A CarZapp number will be assigned
        to the Dealer principle, which will then be given out to subsequent
        users who are registering as part of the same Dealership.</p>
    <p>Software license numbers that we may interact with:</p>
    <p>- Dealers Solutions, Easy Cars, Other</p>
    <p>- Subscription Plans</p>
    <p>Note: CarZapp Pty Ltd reserves the right to block a user from
        registering or using the app.</p>

    <h4 id="2">2 Login</h4>
    <p>The login works by accepting a username and password.</p>
    <p>If a user forgets their password, there is a “Forgot password”
        feature that allows the user to reset their password based on their
        email address.</p>
    <p>The “keep me logged in” option, keeps the user logged in to the
        app until they select to log out. Without selecting this option, the
        app automatically logs the user out after a prolonged period of
        inactivity.</p>
    <h4 id="3">3 Home</h4>
    <p>Welcome and Dashboard. This screen includes 2 sections: 1) The
        flicka scrolling banner; and 2) the dashboard with shortcuts. The
        flicka banner shows images of cars for sale, arranged in an order that
        is set by the user. The order is random by default, but can be set
        according to a choice. For example: Newest cars first; price
        (Ascending/Descending); Age (Ascending/Descending). The images are
        scrolled across by flicking them back or forward.</p>
    <p>The dashboard includes 9 short-cut buttons with summary data:</p>
    <p>Cars For Sale - Total cars in database; Cars Followed - Total
        cars followed; Set&Forget - Total cars in Set&Forget; Chat -
        Total chats unread; My Network - Total Dealers in network; My Stock-
        Total cars in own stock; Flicka ; My Customer - Total Customers; My
        Transactions -Total incomplete transactions.</p>

    <h4 id="4">4 Flicka</h4>
    <p>Flicka is a section of the app that displays cars quickly by
        only displaying a large image and some summary details. The screen
        offers 2 methods of scrolling: 1) by flicking through the images; or
        by clicking on the large Left and Right buttons. The middle star
        allows you to quickly tag and follow cars, and add them to your Cars
        Followed list.</p>
    <p>Flicka allows you to quickly scroll through all cars in the
        database.</p>

    <h4 id="5">5 Car for Sale</h4>
    <p>Enter a keyword or search using the drop down filters to search
        for cars. Options are to enter a keyword and search all makes, or
        select filters starting with make, and then, adding model, series,
        variant, year and other filters.</p>

    <h4 id="6">6 Set &amp; Forget</h4>
    <p>This section allows you to setup search parameters for cars that
        are required but do not exist in the complete CarZapp inventory
        database. As soon as a car exists within the CarZapp inventory
        database, a push notification will alert the Dealer who has created
        the Set & Forget (S&F) record.</p>
    <p>If the S&F is for a particular customer, then the S&F record may
        be tagged against that customers’ name.</p>
    <p>Each S&F may also be broadcast to a list of Dealers, making them
        aware that this car is required by another Dealer.</p>


    <h4 id="7">7 Followed cars</h4>
    <p>By following cars, you are creating a list of cars, that are
        tracked and notifications are sent if any changes are made to these
        cars.</p>

    <h4 id="8">8 My Stock</h4>
    <p>This section displays each Dealers individual inventory. Cars
        are added to the app via direct XML datafeeds which are pushed to the
        app at scheduled times, direct from third party data providers. Cars
        may also be added via a manual keyboard entry and upload images and
        videos, from the mobile phone image library or camera.</p>
    <p>This module includes a VIN lookup, which speeds up the process
        of adding new cars. VIN lookups connect to third party data providers
        and retrieve all details on a car based on the unique VIN chassis
        number. In the future, a registration plate lookup will be available
        Pending Australian government approval.</p>
    <h4 id="9">9 My Transactions</h4>
    <p>This provides a mechanism to enable Dealers to Buy and Sell cars
        in real time.</p>
    <p>Note: The use of My Transaction is not a compulsory function for
        Dealers to trade.</p>
    <p>Each car has a BUY button, which sends a message to the owner,
        indicating a request has come in to purchase that car. To complete the
        trade, the seller needs to click that they agree to the sale. Once a
        transaction has been completed, that car will immediately be available
        for sale to other Dealers, in the name of the new owner.</p>
    <p>The transaction is not paid for on the app, as there is no
        financial transaction that takes place on the app. All financial
        transactions are done outside of the app.</p>


    <h4 id="10">10 My Customer</h4>
    <p>This module maintains a list of customers. The Dealer may record
        existing and new customers names and numbers. The My Customer module
        provides for a real time customer relationship management function,
        with direct phone, SMS and email links to customers, keeping them
        informed of the status of their requests.</p>

    <h4 id="11">11 Chat</h4>
    <p>Chat is a real-time in-app, chat system. Each chat is
        linked to a car. This enables two Dealers to engage in a chat
        communication about a particular car. The Chats are initiated
        from the car listing page. After a chat is initiated, it is then
        visible in the Chat module. Users may continue each chat at any
        stage from the Chat module or from the car listing page and chat
        in real time.</p>


    <h4 id="12">12 Invite a Dealer</h4>
    <p>This is a key feature short cut to invite Dealers to download
        the app and join the Dealer network. With this link, Dealers
        immediately invite colleagues to the platform to start trading. This
        feature is not complete yet.</p>

    <h4 id="13">13 My Network</h4>
    <p>Each Dealer’s may maintain a personalised list of their
        preferred Dealers. The purposes of My Network is:</p>
    <p>+ Set & Forget records are only sent within the Dealers in “My
        Network” (Network).</p>
    <p>+ View others Set & Forget records with permission.</p>
    <p>+ Dealers can block other Dealers from seeing their products or
        communicating with them if they’re not in their Network.</p>
    <p>+ Create sub-groups in the Network grouping other Dealers into
        preferred categories for quick access to them.</p>

    <h4 id="14">14 Settings</h4>
    <p>In this section, the following setup parameters are maintained:</p>
    <p>+ My profile: Including personal information,</p>
    <p>+ General : email templates,</p>
    <p>+ Notifications : Push notification setting preferences,</p>
    <p>+ Other Settings: not used yet,</p>

    <p>+ Transfer: Transfer of cars between users, as cars are assigned
        to employees in a multi user car Dealership. By assigning cars, the
        app transfers them from a default user to another user.</p>
    <p>+ Purge/Delete Chat messages: Purge and delete old data</p>
